The info about flask is added here....

L-1
cmd to run... python -m flask run  (be in the same directory)

L-2 
Adding Templates
templates r simply the html pages that u wanna show...Create a templates folder 



To use that templates...import render_template fn... render_template('file')
Now the webpages just dont have static info..They do have dynamic data toooo
To send the dynamic info from the flask app to html...add posts argument to the render_template fn
{%%} -> for code... {{}} for content
Check the title head..if title is passed, then it is shown as title, else the def is shown

  {% if title %}
    <title>{{title}}</title>
    {% else %}
    <title> Default  Title </title>
    {%endif%}

=>You can see that most of the content of home n about pages is same....So to keep the same data
in one file n only unique data in home n about pages....create layout.html
Move common code into layout....use block content  which can override the layout page block content
with the home n about pages block block content...

In flask static files like css n js should be stored in static directory...use url_for to add the files

Forms...We will use the wtf package of flask that helps us in easy creation of the forms n work on in

pip install flask-wtf

lets make a new file..
One shot---
everything is class in the forms.py
create the reg an dlogin classes and inheirt Flaskform
let create the fields u want and add validators
Now in main py file, Make routes, call the class and render them on page
add form.hidden_tag just to prevent csrf...Go on...rest is understandable
flash msgs in the layout page...If flash msgs are defined te it goes like that...
thats it..
----

flash msg is one time msg...goes after refreshing
